## Scenario
###You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## ASK

# - What is the problem I am trying to solve?
#         - How can your insights drive business decisions?
#         - What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean?
#         - What trends or relationships did you find in the data?
